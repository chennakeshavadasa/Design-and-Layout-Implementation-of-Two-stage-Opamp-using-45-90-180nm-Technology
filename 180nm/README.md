# Design-and-Layout-Implementation-of-Two-stage-Opamp-using-45-90-180nm-Technology
Design and Layout implementation of a high-performance two-stage Operational Amplifier (OPAMP) using 180nm semiconductor technology. Achieved required gain, bandwidth, and power efficiency through simulation and characterization.

# Design-Specification
Vdd = 1.8V <br>
DC Gain = 60db <br>
GBW = 5MHz <br>
PM >=60 degree <br>
Slew rate = 10V/u sec <br>
ICMR(+) = 1.6V <br>
ICMR(-) = 0.8V <br>
Cl = 10pF <br>
Cc >= 2pF <br>
Power Dissipation + minimum <br>

# Design Process 
(W/L) ratio of M3,M4 is found using ICMR(+) <br> 
(W/L) ratio of M1,M2 is found using GBW <br>
I5 is found using Slew Rate <br>
(W/L) ratio of M5 is found using ICMR(-) <br>
(W/L) ratio of M6 is found from Gain and design of M3, M4 <br>

# Technology Used
180nm (simulated once but will try again for better results) <br>
Cadence <br>
LTSpice <br>
